# Kallisti's Vim Markdown Plugin

Have some support for syntax highlighting and folding in markdown files in Vim.
This support is very much customized to the author's own personal likings.

Distributed under the same terms as Vim itself. See [the official Readme](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/README.md "Readme file of Vim's official repositiory").
Please note that I heavily stole from other people's great work for markdown-file support in Vim.
